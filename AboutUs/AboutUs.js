Letâ€™s say we buy some packed lunch, but along with the lunch you get plastic cutlery, some cling wraps, soda bottle and some more plastic used for packaging the food. The best way to reduce this ill effect is wisely choose products you are using. The best way out is to use recyclable plastic or better, use compostable products. Compostable product has many advantages over plastic, it is made up of plant-based raw materials which is renewable and harmless to the environment. As end users, it would be great if we would know about the plastic foot print ';
